This zipped file contains a slide deck comparing the ASP.NET MVC 3 vs. Ruby on Rails and two sample projects showcasing scaffolding, and model-view-controllers completed in ASP MVC 3 and Rails 3 web-frameworks

In order to run the solutions, you need 
(1) Visual Studio 2010 Express edition (minimum)

(2) Rails 3 - I have used RubyMine as an IDE, but an IDE is not necessary. Vim would suffice.
